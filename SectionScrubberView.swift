 This will be the main client interface. Ideally, to use this, the user needs only initialise it with a data source, a delegate and add it to the view hierarchy.
 It will have its own gesture recogniser, and based on the data sources list of section titles, display them accordingly as a side-label.
 It will also notify its delegate of the section change, so the delegate can scroll the collection/tableview to the corresponding section.
